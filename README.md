ABSTRACT:Single sensor-based navigation becomes increasingly hard to meet vehicles’ demands in terms of accuracy, with the development of unmanned car navigation technology. In establishing an integrated navigation system of GPS and odometer by virtue of information fusion technology, this paper proposes to realize error correction using particle filter algorithm. 
To begin with, the navigation systems of both GPS and odometer are studied, in order to analyze their positioning principle and source of error. It is followed by the fusion of velocity and location information of unmanned vehicle obtained by both GPS and odometer based on information fusion technology, together with the establishment of GPS-Odometer based unmanned car error model on the basis of the kinematic model of two-wheel differential unmanned vehicle. 
Secondly, particle filter algorithm is studied, starting with analyzing the shortcomings of traditional filtering algorithm. It is then followed by detailed derivation of particle filter algorithm. Among which, Monte Carlo Law and the re-sampling process, which effectively solved the problem of particle degradation, are highlighted. 
Lastly, the afore-mentioned GPS-Odometer unmanned car model is simulated using particle filter algorithm, results of which show particle filter effectively approximates the real value of the system, that is, particle filter algorithm is capable of effectively correcting errors with the navigation and positioning system of unmanned vehicles.
